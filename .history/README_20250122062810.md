# R3 Assessment Platform

## Overview
R3 Assessment Platform is a comprehensive clinical assessment and report generation system designed to help clinicians evaluate and track developmental progress in children. The platform consists of two main components:

1. **Web Application**: A React-based frontend for clinicians to input assessment data across multiple domains including sensory processing, social communication, behavior, and developmental milestones.

2. **Report Generation System**: An automated system using Google Apps Script and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet to generate detailed clinical reports from assessment data.
