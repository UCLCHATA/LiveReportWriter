# R3 Assessment Platform

## Overview
R3 Assessment Platform is a comprehensive clinical assessment and report generation system designed to help clinicians evaluate and track developmental progress in children. The platform consists of two main components:

1. **Web Application**: A React-based frontend for clinicians to input assessment data across multiple domains including sensory processing, social communication, behavior, and developmental milestones.

2. **Report Generation System**: An automated system using Google Apps Script and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet to generate detailed clinical reports from assessment data.

## Workflow

### 1. Assessment Data Collection
1. Clinician logs into web application
2. Completes assessment form across multiple domains:
   - Sensory Profile
   - Social Communication
   - Behavior and Interests
   - Milestone Tracking
3. Data is validated and submitted to Sheety API
4. Sheety API updates Google Sheet with new assessment data

### 2. Report Generation Process
1. Google Apps Script detects new row in spreadsheet
2. Extracts assessment data and prepares for processing
3. Calls Claude API with structured prompt and assessment data
4. Processes LLM response and extracts content for each section
5. Creates copy of report template
6. Populates template with generated content
7. Saves completed report to Google Drive
8. Sends email notification to clinician

### 3. Report Review & Delivery
1. Clinician receives email with report link
2. Reviews generated report
3. Makes any necessary adjustments
4. Finalizes report for client delivery

## Apps Script Configuration

### Required Script Properties
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Claude API key
- `SPREADSHEET_ID`: ID of the main spreadsheet
- `LOGS_FOLDER_ID`: ID of the folder for storing logs

### Spreadsheet Structure
1. **R3_Form Sheet**:
   - Primary data collection sheet
   - Contains all assessment data
   - Tracks report generation status

2. **Placeholders_Map Sheet**:
   - Maps template placeholders to content requirements
   - Defines writing instructions for each section

3. **API_Logs Sheet**:
   - Tracks all API operations
   - Records errors and processing status

### Template System
- Located in Google Drive
- Uses `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax
- Supports both technical and parent-friendly sections
- Includes dynamic image insertion for charts and timelines

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create `.env` file with required environment variables:
   ```
   VITE_SHEETY_API_ID=your_sheety_api_id
   ```
4. Configure Apps Script:
   - Create new Apps Script project
   - Copy `prompt_and_generate.js` content
   - Set script properties
   - Deploy as web app
   - Configure triggers

5. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
